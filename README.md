# OctoPetShop
Octopus Pet Shop Example Web app written in .NET Core.  This solution consists of:
 - Octopus Pet Shop Web front end
 - Product Service
 - Shopping Cart Service
 - Database project using Dbup

This is a customized fork from the [Octopus Deploy Sample](https://github.com/OctopusSamples/OctoPetShop).  This repo combines how to deploy Azure Bicep files using Octopus Deploy and takes advantage of Config as Code within Octopus Deploy.

# GitHub Actions Workflow
 Within the .github/workflows folder you will find a GitHub Actions Workflow file entitled 'octopetshopbuild.yml'.  This workflow builds the .NET packages, and then pushes them to an Octopus instance ready for deployment to the relevant infrastructure. 

The 'biceppush.yml' GitHub Actions Workflow file takes the Azure Bicep module and template files within the Bicep folder.  Packs them into a ZIP file and then pushes them to the Octopus Deploy server ready for deployment. 

# Bicep Deployment Process

To deploy Bicep template files from Octopus Deploy to Azure we need to package them inside a ZIP file. Once in a ZIP file we can upload them into the Octopus Library.  We deploy our Bicep files using a Octopus Runbook. 

## Create Azure Resource Group
As with any deployment of resources to Azure we need to start with the creation of an Azure resource group.

We use the following command:

```bash
az group create -l $OctopusParameters["Azure.Location"] -n $OctopusParameters["Azure.Environment.ResourceGroup.Name"]
```

We pull in variables from the Octopus Variable library.

Within our Octopus Runbook we use the "Run an Azure Script" step for this part.

## Deploy Bicep instructions
To deploy the Bicep modules and template file we use an Azure Script step within an Octopus Runbook.

We associate the ZIP file that we created with our Bicep files. And run the following:

```powershell
# Reference the package with the Bicep files
$filePath = $OctopusParameters["Octopus.Action.Package[OctoBicepFiles].ExtractedPath"]

# Change Directory to extracted package
cd $filePath

# Set the deployment name
$today=Get-Date -Format "dd-MM-yyyy"
$deploymentName="OctoPetShopInfra"+"$today"

# Deply the Bicep template files
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name $deploymentName -ResourceGroupName $OctopusParameters["Azure.Environment.ResourceGroup.Name"] -TemplateFile octopetshop.bicep -planName $planName -planSku $planSku -sku $sku -productwebSiteName $OctopusParameters["Project.ProductService.Name"] -shoppingwebSiteName $OctopusParameters["Project.ShoppingCartService.Name"] -frontwebSiteName $OctopusParameters["Project.WebApp.Name"] -startFWIpAddress $startFWIpAddress -endFWIpAddress $endFWIpAddress -databaseName $OctopusParameters["Project.Database.Name"] -sqlServerName $OctopusParameters["Project.Database.Server"] -sqlAdministratorLogin $OctopusParameters["Project.Database.Admin.Username"] -sqlAdministratorLoginPassword $OctopusParameters["Project.Database.Admin.Password"]
````
During the deployment command we are passing in the variables that the templates need to deploy. 

Within our Octopus Runbook we use the "Run an Azure Script" step for this part. When configuring this step we ensure we are selecting the package with the Bicep files in as part of this step.

Our runbook, creates the Resource Group, deploys the Bicep files and then associates the new Web Apps with Octopus ready for our application to deploy to them.
